Simply moving the check to a\\nslightly earlier location (specifically, before the line that actually\\nassigns the limit - *old_rlim = new_rlim), does the trick.\\n\\nDo note that at least the zsh (but not ash, dash, or bash) shell has the\\nproblem of \"caching\" the limits set by the ulimit command, so when running\\nzsh the fix will not immediately be evident - after entering \"ulimit -t 0\",\\n\"ulimit -a\" will show \"-t: cpu time (seconds) 0\", even though the actual\\nlimit as returned by getrlimit(...) will be 1.  It can be verified by\\nopening a subshell (which will not have the values of the parent shell in\\ncache) and checking in it, or just by running a CPU intensive command like\\n\"echo \\'65536^1048576\\' | bc\" and verifying that it dumps core after one\\nsecond.\\n\\nRegardless of whether that is a misfeature in the shell, perhaps it would\\nbe better to return -EINVAL from setrlimit in such a case instead of\\ncheating and setting to 1, as that does not really reflect the actual state\\nof the process anymore.

That\\'s fine if we have a hold on inode; however, for all\\nother cases we need to make damn sure we don\\'t race with umount.  We can\\n*NOT* just grab a reference to a watch - inotify_unmount_inodes() will\\nhappily sail past it and we\\'ll end with reference to inode potentially\\noutliving its superblock.\\n\\nIdeally we just want to grab an active reference to superblock if we\\ncan; that will make sure we won\\'t go into inotify_umount_inodes() until\\nwe are done.

In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.

In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.

In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.  If we actually end up in\\nzap_pte_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,\\nand it can\\'t become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained\\nabove).\\n\\nAll we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code\\npath like below, pmd_trans_huge can be false, but pmd_none_or_clear_bad\\ncan run into a hugepmd.  The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler\\ntweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds).  I\\ndon\\'t exclude different compiler versions may have prevented the race\\ntoo by caching the value of *pmd on the stack (that hasn\\'t been\\nverified, but it wouldn\\'t be impossible considering\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad, pmd_bad, pmd_trans_huge, pmd_none are all inlines\\nand there\\'s no external function called in between pmd_trans_huge and\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad).\\n\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_trans_huge(*pmd)) {\\n\\t\\t\\tif (next-addr != HPAGE_PMD_SIZE) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVM_BUG_ON(!rwsem_is_locked(&tlb->mm->mmap_sem));\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsplit_huge_page_pmd(vma->vm_mm, pmd);\\n\\t\\t\\t} else if (zap_huge_pmd(tlb, vma, pmd, addr))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue;\\n\\t\\t\\t/* fall through */\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd))\\n\\nBecause this race condition could be exercised without special\\nprivileges this was reported in CVE-2012-1179.\\n\\nThe race was identified and fully explained by Ulrich who debugged it.\\nI\\'m quoting his accurate explanation below, for reference.\\n\\n====== start quote =======\\n      mapcount 0 page_mapcount 1\\n      kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:1384!\\n\\n    At some point prior to the panic, a \"bad pmd ...\" message similar to the\\n    following is logged on the console:\\n\\n      mm/memory.c:145: bad pmd ffff8800376e1f98(80000000314000e7).\\n\\n    The \"bad pmd ...\" message is logged by pmd_clear_bad() before it clears\\n    the page\\'s PMD table entry.\\n\\n        143 void pmd_clear_bad(pmd_t *pmd)\\n        144 {\\n    ->  145         pmd_ERROR(*pmd);\\n        146         pmd_clear(pmd);\\n        147 }\\n\\n    After the PMD table entry has been cleared, there is an inconsistency\\n    between the actual number of PMD table entries that are mapping the page\\n    and the page\\'s map count (_mapcount field in struct page).

The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.

       "  'message': 'mm: thp: fix pmd_bad() triggering in code paths holding mmap_sem read mode\\n\\nIn some cases it may happen that pmd_none_or_clear_bad() is called with\\nthe mmap_sem hold in read mode.  In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.  If we actually end up in\\nzap_pte_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,\\nand it can\\'t become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained\\nabove).\\n\\nAll we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code\\npath like below, pmd_trans_huge can be false, but pmd_none_or_clear_bad\\ncan run into a hugepmd.  The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler\\ntweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds).

In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.  If we actually end up in\\nzap_pte_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,\\nand it can\\'t become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained\\nabove).\\n\\nAll we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code\\npath like below, pmd_trans_huge can be false, but pmd_none_or_clear_bad\\ncan run into a hugepmd.  The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler\\ntweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds).  I\\ndon\\'t exclude different compiler versions may have prevented the race\\ntoo by caching the value of *pmd on the stack (that hasn\\'t been\\nverified, but it wouldn\\'t be impossible considering\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad, pmd_bad, pmd_trans_huge, pmd_none are all inlines\\nand there\\'s no external function called in between pmd_trans_huge and\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad).\\n\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_trans_huge(*pmd)) {\\n\\t\\t\\tif (next-addr != HPAGE_PMD_SIZE) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVM_BUG_ON(!rwsem_is_locked(&tlb->mm->mmap_sem));\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsplit_huge_page_pmd(vma->vm_mm, pmd);\\n\\t\\t\\t} else if (zap_huge_pmd(tlb, vma, pmd, addr))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue;\\n\\t\\t\\t/* fall through */\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd))\\n\\nBecause this race condition could be exercised without special\\nprivileges this was reported in CVE-2012-1179.\\n\\nThe race was identified and fully explained by Ulrich who debugged it.\\nI\\'m quoting his accurate explanation below, for reference.\\n\\n====== start quote =======\\n      mapcount 0 page_mapcount 1\\n      kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:1384!\\n\\n    At some point prior to the panic, a \"bad pmd ...\" message similar to the\\n    following is logged on the console:\\n\\n      mm/memory.c:145: bad pmd ffff8800376e1f98(80000000314000e7).\\n\\n    The \"bad pmd ...\" message is logged by pmd_clear_bad() before it clears\\n    the page\\'s PMD table entry.\\n\\n        143 void pmd_clear_bad(pmd_t *pmd)\\n        144 {\\n    ->  145         pmd_ERROR(*pmd);\\n        146         pmd_clear(pmd);\\n        147 }\\n\\n    After the PMD table entry has been cleared, there is an inconsistency\\n    between the actual number of PMD table entries that are mapping the page\\n    and the page\\'s map count (_mapcount field in struct page).

The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.

       "  'message': 'mm: thp: fix pmd_bad() triggering in code paths holding mmap_sem read mode\\n\\nIn some cases it may happen that pmd_none_or_clear_bad() is called with\\nthe mmap_sem hold in read mode.  In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.  If we actually end up in\\nzap_pte_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,\\nand it can\\'t become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained\\nabove).\\n\\nAll we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code\\npath like below, pmd_trans_huge can be false, but pmd_none_or_clear_bad\\ncan run into a hugepmd.  The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler\\ntweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds).

In those cases the huge page faults can\\nallocate hugepmds under pmd_none_or_clear_bad() and that can trigger a\\nfalse positive from pmd_bad() that will not like to see a pmd\\nmaterializing as trans huge.\\n\\nIt\\'s not khugepaged causing the problem, khugepaged holds the mmap_sem\\nin write mode (and all those sites must hold the mmap_sem in read mode\\nto prevent pagetables to go away from under them, during code review it\\nseems vm86 mode on 32bit kernels requires that too unless it\\'s\\nrestricted to 1 thread per process or UP builds).  The race is only with\\nthe huge pagefaults that can convert a pmd_none() into a\\npmd_trans_huge().\\n\\nEffectively all these pmd_none_or_clear_bad() sites running with\\nmmap_sem in read mode are somewhat speculative with the page faults, and\\nthe result is always undefined when they run simultaneously.  This is\\nprobably why it wasn\\'t common to run into this.  For example if the\\nmadvise(MADV_DONTNEED) runs zap_page_range() shortly before the page\\nfault, the hugepage will not be zapped, if the page fault runs first it\\nwill be zapped.\\n\\nAltering pmd_bad() not to error out if it finds hugepmds won\\'t be enough\\nto fix this, because zap_pmd_range would then proceed to call\\nzap_pte_range (which would be incorrect if the pmd become a\\npmd_trans_huge()).\\n\\nThe simplest way to fix this is to read the pmd in the local stack\\n(regardless of what we read, no need of actual CPU barriers, only\\ncompiler barrier needed), and be sure it is not changing under the code\\nthat computes its value.  Even if the real pmd is changing under the\\nvalue we hold on the stack, we don\\'t care.  If we actually end up in\\nzap_pte_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,\\nand it can\\'t become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained\\nabove).\\n\\nAll we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code\\npath like below, pmd_trans_huge can be false, but pmd_none_or_clear_bad\\ncan run into a hugepmd.  The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler\\ntweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds).  I\\ndon\\'t exclude different compiler versions may have prevented the race\\ntoo by caching the value of *pmd on the stack (that hasn\\'t been\\nverified, but it wouldn\\'t be impossible considering\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad, pmd_bad, pmd_trans_huge, pmd_none are all inlines\\nand there\\'s no external function called in between pmd_trans_huge and\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad).\\n\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_trans_huge(*pmd)) {\\n\\t\\t\\tif (next-addr != HPAGE_PMD_SIZE) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVM_BUG_ON(!rwsem_is_locked(&tlb->mm->mmap_sem));\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsplit_huge_page_pmd(vma->vm_mm, pmd);\\n\\t\\t\\t} else if (zap_huge_pmd(tlb, vma, pmd, addr))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue;\\n\\t\\t\\t/* fall through */\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd))\\n\\nBecause this race condition could be exercised without special\\nprivileges this was reported in CVE-2012-1179.\\n\\nThe race was identified and fully explained by Ulrich who debugged it.\\nI\\'m quoting his accurate explanation below, for reference.\\n\\n====== start quote =======\\n      mapcount 0 page_mapcount 1\\n      kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:1384!\\n\\n    At some point prior to the panic, a \"bad pmd ...\" message similar to the\\n    following is logged on the console:\\n\\n      mm/memory.c:145: bad pmd ffff8800376e1f98(80000000314000e7).\\n\\n    The \"bad pmd ...\" message is logged by pmd_clear_bad() before it clears\\n    the page\\'s PMD table entry.\\n\\n        143 void pmd_clear_bad(pmd_t *pmd)\\n        144 {\\n    ->  145         pmd_ERROR(*pmd);\\n        146         pmd_clear(pmd);\\n        147 }\\n\\n    After the PMD table entry has been cleared, there is an inconsistency\\n    between the actual number of PMD table entries that are mapping the page\\n    and the page\\'s map count (_mapcount field in struct page).

If we actually end up in\\nzap_pte_range it means the pmd was not none already and it was not huge,\\nand it can\\'t become huge from under us (khugepaged locking explained\\nabove).\\n\\nAll we need is to enforce that there is no way anymore that in a code\\npath like below, pmd_trans_huge can be false, but pmd_none_or_clear_bad\\ncan run into a hugepmd.  The overhead of a barrier() is just a compiler\\ntweak and should not be measurable (I only added it for THP builds).  I\\ndon\\'t exclude different compiler versions may have prevented the race\\ntoo by caching the value of *pmd on the stack (that hasn\\'t been\\nverified, but it wouldn\\'t be impossible considering\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad, pmd_bad, pmd_trans_huge, pmd_none are all inlines\\nand there\\'s no external function called in between pmd_trans_huge and\\npmd_none_or_clear_bad).\\n\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_trans_huge(*pmd)) {\\n\\t\\t\\tif (next-addr != HPAGE_PMD_SIZE) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVM_BUG_ON(!rwsem_is_locked(&tlb->mm->mmap_sem));\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsplit_huge_page_pmd(vma->vm_mm, pmd);\\n\\t\\t\\t} else if (zap_huge_pmd(tlb, vma, pmd, addr))\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontinue;\\n\\t\\t\\t/* fall through */\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\tif (pmd_none_or_clear_bad(pmd))\\n\\nBecause this race condition could be exercised without special\\nprivileges this was reported in CVE-2012-1179.\\n\\nThe race was identified and fully explained by Ulrich who debugged it.\\nI\\'m quoting his accurate explanation below, for reference.\\n\\n====== start quote =======\\n      mapcount 0 page_mapcount 1\\n      kernel BUG at mm/huge_memory.c:1384!\\n\\n    At some point prior to the panic, a \"bad pmd ...\" message similar to the\\n    following is logged on the console:\\n\\n      mm/memory.c:145: bad pmd ffff8800376e1f98(80000000314000e7).\\n\\n    The \"bad pmd ...\" message is logged by pmd_clear_bad() before it clears\\n    the page\\'s PMD table entry.\\n\\n        143 void pmd_clear_bad(pmd_t *pmd)\\n        144 {\\n    ->  145         pmd_ERROR(*pmd);\\n        146         pmd_clear(pmd);\\n        147 }\\n\\n    After the PMD table entry has been cleared, there is an inconsistency\\n    between the actual number of PMD table entries that are mapping the page\\n    and the page\\'s map count (_mapcount field in struct page).

Anything in rds_recvmsg() that returns a non-negative value but does\\nnot go through the \"sin = (struct sockaddr_in *)msg->msg_name;\" code path\\nat the end of the while(1) loop will return up to 128 bytes of kernel memory\\nto userspace.\\n\\nAnd I write two test programs to reproduce this bug, you will see that in\\nrds_server, fromAddr will be overwritten and the following sock_fd will be\\ndestroyed.\\nYes, it is the programmer\\'s fault to set msg_namelen incorrectly, but it is\\nbetter to make the kernel copy the real length of address to user space in\\nsuch case.\\n\\nHow to run the test programs ?\\nI test them on 32bit x86 system, 3.5.0-rc7.\\n\\n1 compile\\ngcc -o rds_client rds_client.c\\ngcc -o rds_server rds_server.c\\n\\n2 run ./rds_server on one console\\n\\n3 run ./rds_client on another console\\n\\n4 you will see something like:\\nserver is waiting to receive data...\\nold socket fd=3\\nserver received data from client:data from client\\nmsg.msg_namelen=32\\nnew socket fd=-1067277685\\nsendmsg()\\n: Bad file descriptor\\n\\n/***************** rds_client.c ********************/\\n\\nint main(void)\\n{\\n\\tint sock_fd;\\n\\tstruct sockaddr_in serverAddr;\\n\\tstruct sockaddr_in toAddr;\\n\\tchar recvBuffer[128] = \"data from client\";\\n\\tstruct msghdr msg;\\n\\tstruct iovec iov;\\n\\n\\tsock_fd = socket(AF_RDS, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);\\n\\tif (sock_fd < 0) {\\n\\t\\tperror(\"create socket error\\\\n\");\\n\\t\\texit(1);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tmemset(&serverAddr, 0, sizeof(serverAddr));\\n\\tserverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;\\n\\tserverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(\"127.0.0.1\");\\n\\tserverAddr.sin_port = htons(4001);\\n\\n\\tif (bind(sock_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr)) < 0) {\\n\\t\\tperror(\"bind() error\\\\n\");\\n\\t\\tclose(sock_fd);\\n\\t\\texit(1);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tmemset(&toAddr, 0, sizeof(toAddr));\\n\\ttoAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;\\n\\ttoAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(\"127.0.0.1\");\\n\\ttoAddr.sin_port = htons(4000);\\n\\tmsg.msg_name = &toAddr;\\n\\tmsg.msg_namelen = sizeof(toAddr);\\n\\tmsg.msg_iov = &iov;\\n\\tmsg.msg_iovlen = 1;\\n\\tmsg.msg_iov->iov_base = recvBuffer;\\n\\tmsg.msg_iov->iov_len = strlen(recvBuffer) + 1;\\n\\tmsg.msg_control = 0;\\n\\tmsg.msg_controllen = 0;\\n\\tmsg.msg_flags = 0;\\n\\n\\tif (sendmsg(sock_fd, &msg, 0) == -1) {\\n\\t\\tperror(\"sendto() error\\\\n\");\\n\\t\\tclose(sock_fd);\\n\\t\\texit(1);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tprintf(\"client send data:%s\\\\n\", recvBuffer);\\n\\n\\tmemset(recvBuffer, \\'\\\\0\\', 128);\\n\\n\\tmsg.msg_name = &toAddr;\\n\\tmsg.msg_namelen = sizeof(toAddr);\\n\\tmsg.msg_iov = &iov;\\n\\tmsg.msg_iovlen = 1;\\n\\tmsg.msg_iov->iov_base = recvBuffer;\\n\\tmsg.msg_iov->iov_len = 128;\\n\\tmsg.msg_control = 0;\\n\\tmsg.msg_controllen = 0;\\n\\tmsg.msg_flags = 0;\\n\\tif (recvmsg(sock_fd, &msg, 0) == -1) {\\n\\t\\tperror(\"recvmsg() error\\\\n\");\\n\\t\\tclose(sock_fd);\\n\\t\\texit(1);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tprintf(\"receive data from server:%s\\\\n\", recvBuffer);\\n\\n\\tclose(sock_fd);\\n\\n\\treturn 0;\\n}\\n\\n/***************** rds_server.c ********************/\\n\\nint main(void)\\n{\\n\\tstruct sockaddr_in fromAddr;\\n\\tint sock_fd;\\n\\tstruct sockaddr_in serverAddr;\\n\\tunsigned int addrLen;\\n\\tchar recvBuffer[128];\\n\\tstruct msghdr msg;\\n\\tstruct iovec iov;\\n\\n\\tsock_fd = socket(AF_RDS, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);\\n\\tif(sock_fd < 0) {\\n\\t\\tperror(\"create socket error\\\\n\");\\n\\t\\texit(0);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tmemset(&serverAddr, 0, sizeof(serverAddr));\\n\\tserverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET;\\n\\tserverAddr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(\"127.0.0.1\");\\n\\tserverAddr.sin_port = htons(4000);\\n\\tif (bind(sock_fd, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr)) < 0) {\\n\\t\\tperror(\"bind error\\\\n\");\\n\\t\\tclose(sock_fd);\\n\\t\\texit(1);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tprintf(\"server is waiting to receive data...\\\\n\");\\n\\tmsg.msg_name = &fromAddr;\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * I add 16 to sizeof(fromAddr), ie 32,\\n\\t * and pay attention to the definition of fromAddr,\\n\\t * recvmsg() will overwrite sock_fd,\\n\\t * since kernel will copy 32 bytes to userspace.\\n\\t *\\n\\t * If you just use sizeof(fromAddr), it works fine.\\n\\t * */\\n\\tmsg.msg_namelen = sizeof(fromAddr) + 16;\\n\\t/* msg.msg_namelen = sizeof(fromAddr);

       "  'message': \"epoll: limit paths\\n\\nThe current epoll code can be tickled to run basically indefinitely in\\nboth loop detection path check (on ep_insert()), and in the wakeup paths.\\nThe programs that tickle this behavior set up deeply linked networks of\\nepoll file descriptors that cause the epoll algorithms to traverse them\\nindefinitely.  A couple of these sample programs have been previously\\nposted in this thread: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/25/297.\\n\\nTo fix the loop detection path check algorithms, I simply keep track of\\nthe epoll nodes that have been already visited.  Thus, the loop detection\\nbecomes proportional to the number of epoll file descriptor and links.\\nThis dramatically decreases the run-time of the loop check algorithm.  In\\none diabolical case I tried it reduced the run-time from 15 mintues (all\\nin kernel time) to .3 seconds.\\n\\nFixing the wakeup paths could be done at wakeup time in a similar manner\\nby keeping track of nodes that have already been visited, but the\\ncomplexity is harder, since there can be multiple wakeups on different\\ncpus...Thus, I've opted to limit the number of possible wakeup paths when\\nthe paths are created.\\n\\nThis is accomplished, by noting that the end file descriptor points that\\nare found during the loop detection pass (from the newly added link), are\\nactually the sources for wakeup events.  I keep a list of these file\\ndescriptors and limit the number and length of these paths that emanate\\nfrom these 'source file descriptors'.  In the current implemetation I\\nallow 1000 paths of length 1, 500 of length 2, 100 of length 3, 50 of\\nlength 4 and 10 of length 5.  Note that it is sufficient to check the\\n'source file descriptors' reachable from the newly added link, since no\\nother 'source file descriptors' will have newly added links.  This allows\\nus to check only the wakeup paths that may have gotten too long, and not\\nre-check all possible wakeup paths on the system.\\n\\nIn terms of the path limit selection, I think its first worth noting that\\nthe most common case for epoll, is probably the model where you have 1\\nepoll file descriptor that is monitoring n number of 'source file\\ndescriptors'.  In this case, each 'source file descriptor' has a 1 path of\\nlength 1.  Thus, I believe that the limits I'm proposing are quite\\nreasonable and in fact may be too generous.  Thus, I'm hoping that the\\nproposed limits will not prevent any workloads that currently work to\\nfail.\\n\\nIn terms of locking, I have extended the use of the 'epmutex' to all\\nepoll_ctl add and remove operations.  Currently its only used in a subset\\nof the add paths.  I need to hold the epmutex, so that we can correctly\\ntraverse a coherent graph, to check the number of paths.  I believe that\\nthis additional locking is probably ok, since its in the setup/teardown\\npaths, and doesn't affect the running paths, but it certainly is going to\\nadd some extra overhead.

       "  'message': \"epoll: limit paths\\n\\nThe current epoll code can be tickled to run basically indefinitely in\\nboth loop detection path check (on ep_insert()), and in the wakeup paths.\\nThe programs that tickle this behavior set up deeply linked networks of\\nepoll file descriptors that cause the epoll algorithms to traverse them\\nindefinitely.  A couple of these sample programs have been previously\\nposted in this thread: https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/25/297.\\n\\nTo fix the loop detection path check algorithms, I simply keep track of\\nthe epoll nodes that have been already visited.  Thus, the loop detection\\nbecomes proportional to the number of epoll file descriptor and links.\\nThis dramatically decreases the run-time of the loop check algorithm.  In\\none diabolical case I tried it reduced the run-time from 15 mintues (all\\nin kernel time) to .3 seconds.\\n\\nFixing the wakeup paths could be done at wakeup time in a similar manner\\nby keeping track of nodes that have already been visited, but the\\ncomplexity is harder, since there can be multiple wakeups on different\\ncpus...Thus, I've opted to limit the number of possible wakeup paths when\\nthe paths are created.\\n\\nThis is accomplished, by noting that the end file descriptor points that\\nare found during the loop detection pass (from the newly added link), are\\nactually the sources for wakeup events.
